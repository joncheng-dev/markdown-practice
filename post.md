### Car Troubles

A post about my visit to the car repair shop. It's winter. It gets quite cold here, temperatures fluctuating anywhere from -10 degrees C to 5 degrees C. We often leave the car parked out for a few days without driving it. Last week, we were going to my in-laws place. We tried starting the car, but it wouldn't start. We had to call in assistance to help jump the car. 

On the drive there, the in-cabin lights changed in brightness irregularly without *anybody changing it*.

During the week at the in-laws, we drove the car just one time. The day afterwards, I started the car to warm up the cabin. After about ten minutes, we were not ready to leave yet &amp; so I turned the ignition back off. When we were ready to leave, the car would not start. 

> We had to call for assistance a second time. After we jumped the car, the radio and navigation would not start. Looks to me we need to replace the battery.

We drove home, and as of now, we are at the car repair shop. They confirmed the battery should be replaced, as it has not been for just over 4 years. A mechanic is looking for a battery for that specific car make and model. 

In case you were wondering, this is the evidence I put together to conclude that it was a battery problem:

### Evidence
- car struggles to start, and fails
- dashboard lights change in brightness / dimness
- navigation / radio display does not turn on
- battery was last replaced over 4 years ago (batteries last roughly 3-5 years)
